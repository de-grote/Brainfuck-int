Basically all variations of brainfuck interpreter were taken already so I'm stuck with this name.

This is just another Brainfuck interpreter with no special features that sets it apart.

Uses 8 bit integers as cells and 30 000 cells by default.

This is a cli, and only ment to be used as a cli.

Use `brainfuck-int -h` to see all options.

## Installation

You can download the cli tool using cargo.

If you have the repository cloned, you can use:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

to install `brainfuck-int` systemwide.

I'm planning on publishing this to cargo at a later time.
