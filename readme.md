Basically all variations of brainfuck interpreter were taken already so I'm stuck with this name.

This is just another Brainfuck interpreter with no special features that sets it apart.

Uses 8 bit integers as cells and 30 000 cells by default.

This is a cli, and only ment to be used as a cli.

Use `brainfuck-int -h` to see all options.
